					Windows signing began with version 1.5.1. The older 1.5.0 direct Windows
					files remain unsigned; their release history has not been rewritten.
					Linux packages do not carry a platform code signature. Their verification
					uses SHA-256 checksums, the Sigstore signature over the checksum list, and
					build provenance.
				</p>
				<p>
					A valid code signature identifies the publisher and protects the signed bytes.
					It does not guarantee that SmartScreen stops warning.
					<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/package-and-deploy/smartscreen-reputation" rel="noopener">Microsoft now documents</a>
					that unsigned, self-signed and newly signed files can receive reputation
					warnings. Extended Validation certificates no longer bypass the reputation
					process. Signing identifies a publisher and protects signed bytes; it is not
					a guarantee of safe behavior.
					Check the publisher alongside the release's checksums and attestation.

			<h2>What carries a signature, and what does not</h2>
			<p>
				Windows Authenticode signing is separate from the release evidence shared by
				Windows and Linux. Starting with version 1.5, the release workflow signs
				<code>SHA256SUMS.txt</code> with Sigstore and
				publishes build provenance for the artifacts. Those records identify this
				project's public workflow and the exact tag in
				<a href="${s.repo}" rel="noopener">this repository</a>; they are not a
				conventional signature on the executable itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>The Microsoft Store package is separate.</strong> Microsoft
				<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/publish/publish-your-app/msix/app-package-requirements" rel="noopener">re-signs the MSIX/AppX package it distributes</a>.
				Windows verifies that package during installation. This does not individually
				code-sign every executable inside it. <a href="/download">The download page</a>
				explains the two distribution channels.
			</p>

			<h2>Team roles</h2>
			<dl class="defs">
				<dt>Committers and reviewers</dt>
				<dd>
					People granted write or review access to the repository. The organisation does
					not publish a member roster, so its public people page is not used as identity
					evidence. Commits, pull-request reviews and workflow runs that actually happen
					remain visible in the public repository.
				</dd>
				<dt>Approvers</dt>
				<dd>
					People with permission to create a release tag and run the release workflow.
					Those GitHub roles are not publicly enumerated. The named publisher accountable
					for the product and its releases is
					<a href="/owners">${s.brand.legal}</a>.
				</dd>
				<dt>Multi-factor authentication</dt>
				<dd>
					Our policy requires it for every person in both roles on GitHub. This is a
					publisher policy statement: GitHub's private membership and account-security
					settings are not public evidence that every account complies. MFA reduces
					password-only compromise; stolen sessions, tokens and compromised workflows
					remain risks that MFA alone does not remove.
				</dd>
			</dl>

			<h2>Privacy</h2>
			<p>
				No ODA backend. No ODA account. No cloud sync. No telemetry. User-requested
				Steam operations contact Valve. In direct GitHub builds, the optional update
				check contacts GitHub; Microsoft Store builds do not perform that check. The
				user-driven browser contacts the sites the user chooses and the third-party
				resources those pages load. Visiting our site through that browser is also
				covered by the website portion of the privacy policy.
				<a href="/privacy">The full privacy policy is here</a>, and
				<a href="/security">the security page</a> describes what the application stores
				and where.
			</p>

			<h2>Verifying a release</h2>
			<p>
				A code signature identifies who signed an executable; it does not identify which
				source produced it. The GitHub release also publishes
				<code>SHA256SUMS.txt</code>, a Sigstore signature over that list, and build
				provenance naming the workflow run, commit and tag.
				<a href="/verify">The verification steps walk through all three</a>, and they are
				worth running whether or not a file is signed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our two official distribution channels are listed on
				<a href="/official">our official domains page</a>.
