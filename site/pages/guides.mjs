			<h2>Two official download channels</h2>
			<p>The Microsoft Store listing and this project's GitHub releases are the two official
				channels. This website links to them and does not serve an installer itself.
				Check <strong>MASTERPANEL LLC</strong> as publisher and use the
				<a href="/official">official-address reference</a> if a link looks unfamiliar.</p>
			<p>Microsoft signs the Store AppX package and checks its integrity during installation.
				The Store's package signature is separate from a publisher signature on a direct
				download. See <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/publish/publish-your-app/msix/app-package-requirements" rel="noopener">Microsoft's signing requirements</a>
				and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/turn-on-automatic-app-updates" rel="noopener">Store update settings</a>.</p>
			<p>${
				s.release.codeSigned
					? `<strong>GitHub ${s.publication.github.latestVersion} Windows downloads are signed and timestamped as MASTERPANEL LLC</strong>
					using Microsoft Azure Artifact Signing.`
					: '<strong>This GitHub release has no publisher code signature on its Windows downloads.</strong>'
			}
				SmartScreen may still warn, and device policy may block an application. A valid
				signature is not a reason to dismiss a malware detection.
				<a href="/verify">Verify the file before running it</a>.</p>

			<h2>Install or update without losing your accounts</h2>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Back up first if you already use ODA.</strong> Keep an independent encrypted
					vault backup, its passphrase and recovery information. Updating the app and replacing
					an account's Steam authenticator are different operations.</li>
				<li><strong>Choose one distribution route.</strong> The Store manages its edition's updates.
					Direct GitHub builds can report a newer release but do not download or install it.
					The portable build has no Store equivalent.</li>
				<li><strong>For a new setup, create your vault.</strong> Then use
					<a href="/import-from-sda">Import maFiles</a> for existing SDA files, or follow
					<a href="/docs">the setup documentation</a>. A phone authenticator requires a
					different <a href="/move-steam-authenticator-to-pc">transfer workflow</a>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The portable launcher keeps account data beside the executable but extracts runtime
				files to Windows Temp while running. It normally removes those runtime files on exit.
				Portable packaging does not bypass an organisation's device policy.</p>

			<h2>Installing a verified Linux download</h2>
			<p>Choose one package. On Debian or Ubuntu, from the download directory, run
				<code>sudo apt install ./open-desktop-authenticator-${s.publication.github.latestVersion}-amd64.deb</code>.
				For the AppImage, enable its executable permission in your file manager, or run
				<code>chmod +x ./open-desktop-authenticator-${s.publication.github.latestVersion}-x86_64.AppImage</code>,
				then open it as your normal user. If it does not launch, report the error and your
				distribution/version through <a href="/support">support</a>. Package availability
				does not establish compatibility with every distribution.</p>

			<h1>Importing maFiles from Steam Desktop Authenticator</h1>
			<p class="lede">
				In ODA, open <strong>Import maFiles → Choose files</strong>, select your SDA
				files, unlock them if encrypted, and review the accounts before importing.
				ODA reads the source files without moving or changing them. This copies an
				existing authenticator; it does not enroll a new one or transfer it off a phone.
			</p>

			<h2>Before you start</h2>
			<div class="callout">
				<p>
					<strong>Keep an independent backup of the complete SDA folder.</strong>
					Do not delete the original or remove Steam Guard to perform this import.
					Turn off automatic confirmation in both applications while checking the setup.
					Retain the backup after migration; matching login codes alone does not verify
					every credential in a maFile.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2>1. Prepare the vault and find your maFiles</h2>
			<p><a href="/download">Install the ODA package for your device</a>, then create
				or unlock its vault. Keep the ODA vault passphrase separately from your backup.
				It may be different from the password you used to encrypt SDA files.</p>
			<p>
				They live in the <code>maFiles</code> folder inside your SDA installation
				directory, one <code>.maFile</code> per account, named after the SteamID —
				plus a <code>manifest.json</code>.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Readable files:</strong> select the account's <code>.maFile</code>.</li>
				<li><strong>Encrypted SDA files:</strong> retain each <code>.maFile</code>, its matching
					<code>manifest.json</code> and the SDA encryption passphrase as a recovery set.</li>
				<li><strong>No maFile, only a phone authenticator:</strong> this guide cannot export
					secrets from Steam Mobile. Read the <a href="/move-steam-authenticator-to-pc">phone-to-PC transfer guide</a>.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>2. Select them</h2>
			<p>
				Choose <strong>Import maFiles</strong> on the accounts screen, then
				<strong>Choose files…</strong> and select the account files. If your maFiles are
				encrypted you also need <code>manifest.json</code>: it holds the salt and
				initialisation vector, and without it an encrypted maFile cannot be decrypted at
				all. If you select an encrypted file and forget the manifest, the application
				looks for one beside the files you picked and adds it for you.
			</p>

			<h2>3. Unlock, if they are encrypted</h2>
			<p>
				You will be asked for the passphrase you set in SDA — not your Steam password,
				and not the passphrase for this application's vault. It is used to decrypt the
				files in memory and is not stored. Select <strong>Decrypt</strong>; readable
				accounts then appear under <strong>Found</strong>. If no files are encrypted,
				skip this step.
			</p>

			<h2>4. Review what was found</h2>
			<p>
				Nothing has been written yet at this point. The report lists each account it
				could read and flags anything that matters:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Accounts already in your vault, so you do not import a duplicate.</li>
				<li>
					An <code>identity_secret</code> that is present but unusable — the account
					remains selectable with a warning. Login codes may still work when the
					<code>shared_secret</code> is usable, but confirmations will not.
				</li>
				<li>
					A maFile with no revocation code. ODA cannot use its built-in deactivation
					option without that code; Steam may offer recovery through a linked phone
					number or Steam Support. <a href="/lost-authenticator">Recovery routes</a>.
				</li>
				<li>A proxy setting found inside the file. Its separate opt-in starts off;
					leave it off unless you recognise and still use that routing address.</li>
				<li>
					Files that could not be read at all, and why. A missing or empty
					<code>identity_secret</code> is rejected here rather than imported.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Check the account name and SteamID, tick only the rows you want, then select
				<strong>Import</strong> with the displayed account count. Existing vault accounts
				start unticked: choosing one permits replacing its stored copy. Back up the vault
				before doing that. If you opted into a proxy, a separate dialog identifies its
				address before import; decline it if you do not recognise the destination.
			</p>
			<p>
				Read each <strong>Result</strong> row: <em>imported</em> and <em>replaced</em>
				mean the vault entry was written; <em>skipped</em> does not. An imported account
				can still have a recovery-backup warning that needs attention.
				Uncommitted staged files are discarded when you leave, lock the vault, or the
				ten-minute staging window expires.
			</p>

			<h2>5. Confirm the codes match</h2>
			<p>
				Put ODA and a working copy of that account's authenticator side by side and
				compare the five-character codes within the same time window. If they differ,
				check the account and <a href="/steam-guard-code-not-working">time synchronisation</a>.
				Matching codes checks code generation at that moment, not all account functions.
			</p>
			<dl class="defs">
				<dt>Steam session and confirmations</dt>
				<dd>Open Confirmations for that account and sign in when prompted. Refresh the list.
					A successfully loaded empty list is different from a sign-in or connection error;
					neither a matching code nor a file import proves a pending confirmation can be approved.
					<a href="/approve-steam-confirmations-desktop">Troubleshoot the session and review workflow</a>.
					Do not create or approve a trade merely to finish this guide.</dd>
				<dt>Recovery and backups</dt>
				<dd>Keep the original backup and confirm you can read the saved recovery information.
					Record the recovery code outside the vault where available. Do not deactivate
					Steam Guard to test a code; <a href="/steam-revocation-code">review the recovery-code guidance</a>.</dd>
			</dl>

			<h2>If an import does not complete</h2>
			<div class="tbl" role="region" aria-label="Import problems and next steps" tabindex="0">
				<table>
					<thead><tr><th scope="col">What ODA shows</th><th scope="col">Next step</th></tr></thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr><th scope="row">Encrypted, missing manifest</th><td>Choose the files again with the matching <code>manifest.json</code> from the same SDA backup. A passphrase cannot replace missing encryption parameters.</td></tr>

						<tr><th scope="row">Staging expired or vault locked</th><td>Unlock the vault and choose the files again. Nothing left only in the preview was imported.</td></tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
			</div>

			<h2>Leaving again</h2>
			<p>
				Use an account's <strong>Export</strong> button to save a standard
				<code>.maFile</code>. The file is <strong>unencrypted</strong>, even when the
				original import was encrypted. It contains authenticator secrets and any
				revocation code. Store it in a secure location and never upload it to a website
				or support report. ODA deliberately omits the Steam refresh token and proxy
				configuration: sign in again and configure routing in the destination app.
				Code compatibility does not guarantee that an unmaintained app's Steam login
				or confirmation features still work.

				<h2>Do this before you delete anything</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Uninstalling does not remove the authenticator from your Steam
					account.</strong> Steam still expects codes from an authenticator this
					application was generating. Deleting your only usable copy can leave you
					unable to sign in until you complete Steam's recovery process.
				</p>
				<p>Either, for each account:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Verify access elsewhere</strong> — check another working copy of
						the authenticator, or make and test a secure export or backup before
						removing this one. Uninstalling ODA does not require disabling Steam Guard.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>If you intend to deactivate it</strong>, use Remove account and
						explicitly select <em>Also remove the authenticator from Steam</em>. Ordinary
						removal only removes the vault entry. Deactivation needs the revocation
						code and your passphrase; it can cause Steam trading restrictions. Read
						<a href="/steam-guard-trade-holds">the consequences</a> first.
					</li>

						<strong>Or make sure you have the revocation code</strong> — the

					extracts Electron and Chromium runtime files to Windows Temp; it normally
					removes that runtime-only stage on exit.

				This project operates no server that stores a copy of your vault or account

				Vault and recovery contents are encrypted. Other application data is not

				need for access, with their passphrases stored separately.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Exports you made are not in there.</strong> A <code>.maFile</code> you
				exported went wherever you saved it, and those are unencrypted unless you
				encrypted them yourself. If you were leaving for another authenticator, that
				file is the one you are keeping; if you were not, it is the one to delete first.

			<h1>Documentation</h1>
			<p class="lede">
				Choose the task you need to complete, then follow the relevant steps.
				This page also covers ODA's vault, backups and everyday controls.
			</p>
			<ul class="plain next">
				<li><a href="/steam-desktop-authenticator"><strong>Choose an authenticator</strong></a> — original SDA, Steam Mobile or ODA.</li>
				<li><a href="/download"><strong>Get ODA for your device</strong></a> — packages, updates and release verification.</li>

			</ul>

			<h2>Getting started</h2>
			<dl class="defs">
				<dt><a href="/import-from-sda">Importing from SDA</a></dt>
				<dd>Bringing existing maFile accounts across, including encrypted ones.</dd>
				<dt>Creating a vault</dt>
				<dd>
					On first run you choose a passphrase. It protects every secret the
					vault stores, and ODA cannot reset it. Use a strong, unique passphrase and
					keep a secure record separately from your vault backup.
				</dd>
				<dt>Adding an authenticator</dt>
				<dd>
					Choose <strong>Add authenticator</strong> for an account without a mobile
					authenticator. Sign in and complete Steam's sign-in challenge. Activation
					then uses a separate code delivered by Steam; follow the screen's email or
					phone-number hint. Record the revocation code outside this computer and
					confirm the backup when asked. If an authenticator already exists, use
					<a href="/move-steam-authenticator-to-pc">Move authenticator</a> instead of
					removing it first. If an operation's outcome is uncertain, follow its
					recovery instructions before attempting it again.
				</dd>
			</dl>

			<h2>Everyday use</h2>
			<dl class="defs">
				<dt>Codes</dt>
				<dd>
					Each account shows its current code and how much of the thirty-second window
					is left. Copy places it on the clipboard; ODA attempts to clear its own
					entry after 30 seconds by default, configurable in Settings. This does not
					clear clipboard history, cloud sync or copies already read by other apps.
				</dd>
				<dt><a href="/approve-steam-confirmations-desktop">Confirmations</a></dt>
				<dd>
					Trades and market listings awaiting approval, with what Steam said about
					each: what is being traded, with whom, and when it was raised. Approve or
					cancel individually. Verify the recipient and items yourself before approving;
					a familiar account name is not proof that the request is yours.
				</dd>
				<dt>Automatic confirmation</dt>
				<dd>
					Optional, per account, and limited to market listings and trades. Anything
					else — most importantly an account recovery request — is held back and
					reported in Activity rather than approved. This limit is in the code, not in
					a setting.
					Automatic approval can still authorise an unwanted trade or sale. Leave it
					off if you need to review each request.
				</dd>
				<dt>Activity</dt>
				<dd>
					What automatic confirmation did while you were not watching, and anything it
					refused. The place to look if something feels wrong.
				</dd>
			</dl>

			<h2>Keeping access</h2>
			<dl class="defs">
				<dt><a href="/steam-revocation-code">Revocation codes</a></dt>
				<dd>
					The code that detaches an authenticator from Steam. Revealing one requires
					your passphrase again even when the vault is unlocked. Store it somewhere
					that is not this computer.
				</dd>
				<dt>Backups</dt>
				<dd>
					The vault keeps the previous version of itself beside the current one. If the
					vault file is damaged, the unlock screen offers to load that backup. Restoring
					returns local records to how they were when the backup was written. It does
					not undo a Steam-side transfer or deactivation. The adjacent backup is also
					lost if the disk fails or the whole data folder is deleted: keep a separate
					encrypted copy and retain the passphrase that opens it.
				</dd>
				<dt>Recovery files</dt>
				<dd>
					Written automatically for imported, enrolled and transferred authenticators,
					and kept when a vault entry is removed. Address any backup warning shown by
					the application. A file needs the vault passphrase in force when it was
					written; changing today's passphrase does not unlock an older copy with the
					new one. A file cannot revive secrets Steam has replaced or deactivated.
				</dd>
			</dl>

			<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
			<dl class="defs">
				<dt>Steam rejects the codes</dt>
				<dd>
					Check the clock first. Codes depend on time, and clock drift can make them
					invalid. ODA attempts to obtain Steam's time offset and shows time-sync
					failures; do not infer Steam's acceptance tolerance from the 30-second code
					period. <a href="/steam-guard-code-not-working">The full
					walkthrough, including the fixes on Windows and phone, is here.</a>
				</dd>
				<dt>An imported account cannot confirm trades</dt>
				<dd>
					Its maFile may have an <code>identity_secret</code> whose value is present
					but unusable; current imports flag this with a warning. Login codes may still
					work when the <code>shared_secret</code> is usable, but confirmations cannot.
					First check sign-in, connectivity and the account's configured proxy. If
					the secret is unusable, re-import a known-good copy; if none exists, use
					<a href="/lost-authenticator">Steam's recovery or transfer routes</a> before
					considering removal and re-enrollment.
				</dd>
				<dt>Sign-in wants approval on another device</dt>
				<dd>
					Steam is asking for confirmation on the device that already holds the
					authenticator. Use its current code if the sign-in screen offers that route.
					If the device is gone, <a href="/lost-authenticator">Steam's recovery flow</a>
					may use your recovery code, linked phone number or proof of ownership.

				<li>For a suspected clone site: the URL, and where you encountered it.</li>

			<h2>What happens to a report</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>You get a link</strong>, holding a reference in the form
					<code>ODA-7K2M-B9QW</code> and the key that opens it. <strong>Keep the whole
					link</strong> — the reference on its own will not open the report, and there
					is no account to recover it from.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Our triage policy:</strong> anything
					describing lost access, lost items, or a secret behaving unexpectedly is
					looked at ahead of everything else.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Our aim is to answer each report</strong>, including a reason if we
					cannot make the requested change. General reports have no guaranteed response
					time. Steam account recovery and item disputes must go through Steam Support.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Reporting a clone site</h2>
			<p>
				Fake authenticator downloads are the reason this project exists, and a report
				takes a minute. Send the URL and where you found it — a search result, an
				advertisement, a video description, a Discord message. We collect them, warn
				about the patterns on the <a href="/scam-clones">scam clones page</a>, and report
				the worst to the registrars and hosts involved.
			</p>
			<p>
				You do not need to be sure. A site that turns out to be legitimate costs us five
				minutes; one that turns out not to be may save somebody their inventory.
			</p>

			<h2 id="security-reports">Security reports</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Do not open a public issue for a security problem.</strong> There are
					two published private routes:
			</p>
			<ul class="plain next">
				<li>
					<strong><a href="https://github.com/opendesktopauthenticator/open-desktop-authenticator/security/advisories/new" rel="noopener">GitHub private vulnerability
					reporting</a></strong> — preferred. It keeps the discussion in a private
					advisory rather than a public issue and requires a GitHub account. If it is
					unavailable, use the email route.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>By email</strong>, if you would rather not use GitHub. The address is
					published in
					<a href="/.well-known/security.txt">our security.txt</a>, which is the
					standard place to look for security contact information. The same address
					is also in the repository's SECURITY.md.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				What we commit to, in writing: acknowledgement within 72 hours, an initial
				assessment within 7 days, and a fix or a dated plan within 30 days for a
				confirmed high or critical. Those are the commitments of a single maintainer,
				and if one is going to be missed we will say so before the deadline rather than
				after. The full policy is in
				<a href="${'https://github.com/opendesktopauthenticator/open-desktop-authenticator/blob/main/SECURITY.md'}" rel="noopener">SECURITY.md</a>.
			</p>

				Please give us a reasonable window to release a fix before publishing details.
				We will not use that window to argue you into silence, and we will credit you
				unless you would rather we did not.
