			<h1>The work this is built on</h1>
			<p class="lede">
				ODA depends on public libraries and protocol research from other developers.
				DoctorMcKay's Steam libraries provide a shipped sign-in dependency, test
				references and inspectable examples of Steam's authentication and confirmation
				flows. The specific relationships are listed below.
			</p>

			<div class="origin-note">
				<p>
					<strong>${escape(MCKAY.name)}</strong> has maintained the open-source Steam
					libraries for years under the MIT licence. His
					<a href="${MCKAY.donate}" rel="noopener">donation page</a> explains how
					contributions support his open-source work.
				</p>
				<a class="button" href="${MCKAY.donate}" rel="noopener">Donate to him →</a>
			</div>

			<h2>What we actually use</h2>
			<p>
				Stated precisely, because vague gratitude is worth less than an accurate
				account of the debt:
			</p>
			<ul class="thread">
${LIBRARIES.map(
	(l) => `				<li class="message message-us">
					<div class="message-head">
						<span class="message-who"><a href="${l.url}" rel="noopener">${escape(l.name)}</a></span>
						<span class="message-when">${escape(l.role)}</span>
					</div>
					<p>${l.body}</p>
				</li>`
).join('\n')}
			</ul>

			<h2>Why this matters more than a credits line</h2>
			<p>
				Everything on this site argues the same point: that you should not have to trust
				a stranger with the keys to your Steam account, because you can check the thing
				instead. That argument only works if there is something to check — an
				alternative that is open, inspectable and not the only game in town.
			</p>
			<p>
				Public implementations let developers compare results, identify mistakes and
				build compatible tools. Credit should identify the code actually used and the
				research consulted; it should not imply that the upstream maintainer reviewed
				or endorses every downstream application.
			</p>
			<p>
				The MIT licence permits reuse, including commercial reuse, subject to its
				notice requirements. It does not require a donation. We do not know the
				maintainer's total funding or employment arrangements; our reason to link his
				donation page is the value of the work we use.
			</p>

			<h2>Donate to him directly</h2>
			<p>
				These destinations match the links on his donation page, checked on
				12 September 2026. Payments do not pass through ODA. The payment platform or
				network may charge fees; check its terms and the destination before sending.

			<h1>Donate</h1>
			<p class="lede">
				ODA and this documentation are free. There is no paid tier or ODA account,
				and donating does not unlock features or buy priority support. The project's
				stated plan is to keep it that way.
			</p>

			<h2>What you get either way</h2>
			<p>
				This matters more than the request, so it comes first. Whether or not anybody
				ever donates:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>The source is public</strong> under the MIT licence, including
					the code that handles secrets, networking, updates and the interface.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>The application has no ODA backend, ODA account, cloud sync or telemetry.</strong>
					Requested Steam operations contact Valve, direct GitHub builds can optionally
					check GitHub for updates, and its browser loads the pages you open and their
					embedded resources. The website has separate analytics and report storage.
					<a href="/security">The security page documents those boundaries</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>The scam-clone research stays up</strong>, free to read, with no
					registration and no advertising —
					<a href="/scam-clones">the clone-site page</a>,
					<a href="/verify">the verification instructions</a> and
					<a href="/steam-inventory-stolen">the account of how we learned this</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Reports follow the same triage policy</strong> whether or not the
					person filing one has donated. General support has no guaranteed response time.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>What it pays for</h2>
			<dl class="defs">
${SPENDS.map(
	(x) => `				<dt>${escape(x.what)} <span class="muted">— ${escape(x.cost)}</span></dt>

				<p>
					<strong>Before you consider us, consider
					<a href="/credits">${escape(MCKAY.name)}</a>.</strong> This application
					depends on his freely available libraries,

			</div>

			<h2>Cryptocurrency only</h2>
			<p>
				This page accepts the listed cryptocurrencies and networks only. It does not
				collect card details or create a donor account. <strong>That does not make a
				payment anonymous.</strong> These networks publish transaction records, and a
				wallet or exchange may hold information connecting an address to you. Check
				your provider's privacy terms; <a href="https://ethereum.org/zero-knowledge-proofs" rel="noopener">Ethereum's explanation of public transaction visibility</a>
				describes why pseudonymous payments can be linked to people.
				Donations are optional; do not buy cryptocurrency
				solely because you feel obliged to support this project.
			</p>

			<div class="callout callout-warn">
				<h2>Check the address you paste</h2>
				<p>
					After pasting, compare the address against this page — <strong>all of it, not
					just the ends</strong>. Checking the first and last four characters is a quick
					first look, and it is the check the attack is built to survive: address
					generators produce lookalikes that match at both ends and differ in the
					middle. Confirm the network as well as the address.
				</p>
				<p>
					Check the asset, network and any withdrawal fee in your wallet. A small test
					transfer can help check the route, but recheck the address for the final
					transfer too. Transfers generally cannot be reversed, and sending on the
					wrong network can make funds inaccessible. We cannot guarantee recovery of
					a mistaken payment.

			</ul>

			<p class="hint">
				The build validates these address formats. Tron and Litecoin use checksum
				checks; the listed lowercase EVM address is checked for its shape, and the
				Solana address for a valid 32-byte encoding. <strong>Not every typo is caught,
				and no format check proves ownership.</strong>
				<a href="${s.repo}/blob/main/site/addresses.mjs" rel="noopener">Read the exact checks</a>.
			</p>

			<h2>Other ways, if money is not one</h2>
			<p>
				These are worth more than a small donation and cost nothing:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong><a href="/support">Report a clone site</a></strong> when you find one.
					Send the URL and where you found it, without downloading or running a
					suspected malicious file.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Correct us.</strong> A wrong instruction on
					<a href="/verify">the verification page</a> is worse than no instruction.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Share the verification guide</strong> before somebody runs an
					installer: a checksum alone does not establish who published the file.
				</li>
			</ul>
