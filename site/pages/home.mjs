			<h2>What it does</h2>
			<div class="grid">
				<section>
					<h3>Steam Guard codes</h3>
					<p>
						The five-character code, regenerated every thirty seconds, with the time
						remaining shown as it drains. Copy puts it on the clipboard and attempts
						to clear that entry on a timer. Clipboard history and other apps' copies
						are outside that clearing.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Trade and market confirmations</h3>
					<p>
						Approve or cancel the confirmations Steam would otherwise send to a phone.
						Optional automatic confirmation is limited to market listings and trades,
						and cannot be widened to cover account-recovery requests.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Import from SDA</h3>
					<p>
						Reads <code>.maFile</code> accounts, including encrypted ones with their
						<code>manifest.json</code>. Nothing is written to your vault until you
						choose what to keep. <a href="/import-from-sda">How importing works</a>.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>An encrypted vault</h3>
					<p>
						Secrets are sealed with a key derived from your passphrase using scrypt,
						then encrypted with AES-256-GCM. The vault locks itself when you stop
						using it. <a href="/security">The full security model</a>.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Adding a new authenticator</h3>
					<p>
						Move Steam Guard onto this app for an account that does not have an
						authenticator yet, including the revocation code you must write down
						and confirm you have saved outside this computer. Complete Steam's separate
						activation challenge as shown by the app.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Recovery that exists in advance</h3>
					<p>
						Encrypted account recovery files are created during import, enrollment and
						transfer, and retained after a vault entry is removed. They need the
						passphrase used when written. Keep an independent backup: a file on the
						same disk cannot protect you from losing that disk.

			<h2>Why this exists</h2>
			<p>
				ODA provides a desktop workspace for people who already manage Steam accounts
				and maFile backups on a PC. It is a separate implementation, with its own
				source, release process and support. The original
				<a href="/steam-desktop-authenticator">Steam Desktop Authenticator and ODA</a>
				are different projects; that guide links the genuine original and explains
				your choices, including Valve's official mobile app.
			</p>
			<p>
				Using a desktop authenticator puts the Steam session and its second factor
				on the same computer. If you do not need that workflow, use
				<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/mobile" rel="noopener">Steam Mobile</a>
				on a separate phone. If you choose ODA, review its
				<a href="/security">security model</a>, <a href="/verify">verify the download</a>
				and keep an independent backup before importing accounts.
			</p>

			<h2>What it will not do</h2>
			<ul class="plain">
				<li>
					<strong>No ODA backend. No ODA account. No cloud sync. No telemetry.</strong>
					Steam operations you request contact Valve and send the data needed for that
					operation. In a direct GitHub build, the optional update check asks GitHub's
					public releases API whether a newer version exists; GitHub receives that
					request and its source IP, but no Steam account or vault data. Store builds do
					not perform that GitHub check. ${browserFeatureCopy(s).security}
					<a href="/security">The security model</a> sets out what each part can access.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Direct downloads are updated manually.</strong> If enabled, the
					GitHub update check reports a newer version and links to its release; it
					does not download or install it. The Microsoft Store manages updates for
					the Store edition, subject to your Store settings.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>It never auto-confirms an account-recovery request.</strong> Automatic
					confirmation works from a fixed allowlist of two types — trades and market
					listings — and account recovery is not on it and cannot be added by a
					setting. Those two types can still move items and money, which is why the
					feature is off until you turn it on, per account, and why
					<a href="/security">the security model describes what it costs you</a>.
