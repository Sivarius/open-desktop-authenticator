	),
	'scam-clones': record(
		'A guide that first routes exposed users to account recovery, then helps people who have not run a download check its origin before handing it Steam secrets.',
		'Its ordered response links Steam account recovery, distinguishes replacing copied authenticator secrets from changing a password, and explains applicable Market and CS2 recovery limits using primary sources.'
	),
	'steam-inventory-stolen': record(
		'A clearly attributed account of a suspected counterfeit authenticator, explaining why working codes do not establish that a download is safe.',
		'It separates the unnamed team member’s recollection from unverified conclusions about exfiltration and recipient accounts, avoids an unsupported monetary estimate, and links current Valve rules independently of the story.'
	),
	verify: record(
		'A copyable procedure for verifying ODA downloads from Microsoft Store, GitHub or Softonic.',
		'It walks through SHA-256 calculation, checksum comparison, GitHub attestation/Sigstore identity, Windows publisher checks and source builds, while only showing commands supported by the current release state.'
	),
	security: record(
		'A concrete threat model for where Steam secrets live, which boundaries protect them, and which risks remain.',
		'It names the vault format and cryptography, derives dependency counts from the package data, links the relevant source file, documents deliberate refusals and caveats, and provides private vulnerability reporting.'
	),
	official: record(
		'A complete allowlist of the domains and storefronts ODA actually publishes from, with the role of each address.',
		'It links the three official download sources directly, distinguishes the publisher websites from distributors, and explains how to investigate an unfamiliar address.'
	),
	'code-signing-policy': record(
		'A precise distinction between Windows publisher signatures through Azure Artifact Signing, Store package signing, checksum-list signing and build provenance.',
		'It points to the published v1.5.1 release, names MASTERPANEL LLC as signer, separates unsigned historical Windows releases and Linux packages, and explains accountable release roles and remaining limits.'

	),
	'how-to-open-mafile': record(
		'A safe, reversible workflow for locating, copying, identifying and inspecting a maFile without exposing or damaging it.',

	),
	'encrypted-mafile': record(
		'A diagnosis guide for the common case where the right SDA passphrase still fails because manifest.json is missing.',

	),
	'lost-authenticator': record(
		'A recovery decision tree ordered by what the user still has: secret copy, phone number, revocation code or only Steam Support.',

		'A branching plan that helps users choose transfer, phone recovery, revocation-code recovery or Steam Support without accidentally taking a 15-day path.',

		'Follow ODA’s phone-to-PC transfer prerequisites and actual controls while preserving recovery access and knowing how to respond if a transfer stops partway through.',

	'steam-guard-trade-holds': record(
		'One comparison of Steam holds and restrictions by trigger, duration and avoidability, including the costly remove-and-re-enrol path.',

		'A troubleshooting sequence that begins with an easy, non-destructive check for clock drift, then examines account selection and authenticator changes.',

	),
	'steam-guard-without-phone': record(
		'A clear separation between needing a smartphone, needing a phone number, and accepting the recovery trade-offs of either choice.',
		'It cites Valve’s current no-number setup route, labels the one-account completion as an observation, and itemizes the SMS transfer and recovery capabilities the user gives up.'
	),
	'approve-steam-confirmations-desktop': record(
		'Review a pending Steam confirmation on a desktop, distinguish signing from accepting a trade, and diagnose a missing or incomplete list before approving anything.',
		'The procedure names ODA’s real confirmation controls, separates code generation from authenticated session access, and checks incomplete-list and approval behavior against the application and Valve guidance.'
	),
	'steam-mobile-vs-desktop-authenticator': record(
		'A decision guide that recommends Valve’s mobile app by default and identifies the narrower cases where desktop custody may be worth it.',

	),
	alternatives: record(
		'A user-centered comparison of Steam Mobile, original SDA and ODA that explicitly allows the right answer to be someone else’s product.',
		'It checks the options against Valve guidance and SDA’s official repository, applies the same practical questions to all three, and states ODA’s youth and unfinished assurances.'
	),
	download: record(
		'A live release-status page covering the Store, the project’s GitHub release and the Softonic Windows listing, with package and update details.',
		'Its versions, architectures, signatures and open gaps are derived from the verified publication/release state; it also links the license, source, build route and verification procedure.'
	),
	'import-from-sda': record(
		'A non-destructive migration procedure that shows what is read, what is flagged before storage, how to prove the import worked, and how to leave again.',
		'It mirrors the application’s real import checks—manifest recovery, decryption in memory, duplicates, missing secrets and proxy data—and asks the user to compare live codes side by side before deleting SDA.'
	),
	uninstall: record(
		'A safe removal guide that separates uninstalling the executable from deleting the only remaining copy of authenticator data.',
		'It names the platform-specific app and data locations, puts revocation/export recovery ahead of deletion, and explains exactly what remains after each uninstall path.'
	),
	docs: record(
		'A task-oriented hub that routes readers to setup, everyday use, recovery, troubleshooting, maFile reference and authenticator choice without forcing a search.',

	),
	faq: record(
		'Direct answers to the trust and operating questions a cautious user asks before giving software a Steam secret.',
		'It links the MIT license and deeper security/verification pages, distinguishes offline code generation from online Steam operations, and derives release caveats from shared truth instead of hand-written claims.'
	),
	support: record(
		'An accountless, trackable route for bugs, documentation corrections, clone reports and security issues, with explicit secret-handling warnings.',

	),
	owners: record(
		'Identify the publisher, its commercial relationships, the basis of product documentation and the correct route for an ordinary correction or private vulnerability report.',
		'It links source history, official channels and the maintainer test record, discloses AI assistance and publisher accountability, and distinguishes historical observations from independent audit or current platform testing.'
	),
	credits: record(
		'A dependency-level account of whose reverse engineering makes desktop Steam authentication possible and how readers can support that maintainer directly.',
		'It links each DoctorMcKay library to its repository, explains the job each performs, and sends donations to the maintainer’s own verified pages rather than reproducing an address.'
	),
	donate: record(
		'A transparent account of what remains free, what donations fund, the accepted networks, and useful non-monetary alternatives.',
		'Every address comes from one checked data source, the page links the build-time validation code, identifies checksum limits by network, and warns users to verify the pasted address and chain.'
	),
	privacy: record(
		'A line-item disclosure of what the app, website and support system store, who else receives data and how to request early deletion.',
		'It separates local vaults and exports from server data, names support cookies and external services, distinguishes live-data deletion from backup expiry, and explains the scope of analytics controls.'
