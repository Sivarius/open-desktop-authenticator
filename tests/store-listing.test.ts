/**
 * **The Store listing, which nothing else in this repository can see.**
 *
 * `docs/STORE_LISTING.md` says it plainly: a listing is re-entered in Partner
 * Center on every submission, so it is the one piece of user-facing copy that
 * can drift from the site and the README without a single check going red.
 *
 * It already has. Submission 1 shipped "our download button only ever links a
 * file published on our GitHub releases page", written when GitHub was the only
 * channel — and it stopped being true the moment the listing itself existed.
 * The sentence is the anti-counterfeit warning, and it is displayed *on the
 * Store page*, so the people it reaches are the ones who just installed from the
 * Store, being told that genuine builds come only from somewhere else and that
 * "anything else claiming to be this application is not ours".
 *
 * These check the file, which is what gets pasted into Partner Center. They
 * cannot check what is live — nothing here can — but they stop the source of
 * that paste from going wrong again, and they keep it agreeing with the site
 * that says the same thing to the same people.
